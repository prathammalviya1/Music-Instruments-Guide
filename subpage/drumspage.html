             <div class="information"><b>POPULARITY</b><br>
                The electric drums became popular with time. In 1997, major brands such as Yamaha took the initiative 
                of developing the product. Today these electric drums are among the most popular drum types, 
                and are widely used by beginners for practice. It was in the 1900s that drums became 
                an integral part of musical bands.
                now a days drums are likely popular compared to other musical instruments.<br><br>
                
                <b>DIFICULTY LEVEL</b><br>
                 You can learn a well-known song/beat on the drums in around 30 minutes. 
                 It often takes 2 years for you to gain a detailed understanding of the drums. 
                 If you want to become a professional drummer, 
                 7 to 8 years is typical, but can be faster if you practice harder.<br><br>
                
                <b>TIME TO LEARN</b><br>
                The best age to start drum lessons is generally between ages 6 to 7, 
                as this is the age where most students gain the mental focus needed to learn an instrument.<br><br>
                
                <b>PRICE</b><br>
                For a good drum set it costs around Rs.25000 at least <br><br></div>
