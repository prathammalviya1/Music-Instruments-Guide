             <div class="information"><b>POPULARITY</b><br>
                The popularity of the classical guitar in India has historically been quite low, 
                but over the last three decades or so, thanks to the Indian Guitar Federation and
                 its associated bodies, and dedicated and inspiring teachers, India has been training 
                 an ever-growing number of classical guitarists every year
                .<br><br>
                
                <b>DIFICULTY LEVEL</b><br>
                Guitar is hard to learn in the beginning, but gets easier the longer you stick with it. 
                The more you practice, the easier guitar will feel to play.<br>If you want learn by yourself;
                 It is definitely possible to learn guitar by yourself and if you follow the right advice, it isn't hard. It's important to remember that everybody finds it hard to learn gu
                    itar in the beginning whether you have a guitar teacher helping you or you're learning by yourself.<br><br>
                
                <b>TIME TO LEARN</b><br>
                For most students, the best age to learn guitar is around age 7. But it's important to note 
                that all students are different, so there really isn't a best age to start guitar lessons. 
                Realistically, students can start guitar lessons as 
                soon as they can comfortably hold a small-scale guitar and press down the strings.<br><br>
                
                <b>PRICE</b><br>
                For acoustic guitar it's around Rs.5000<br>
                For electric guitar it's around Rs.7500 <br><br></div>
